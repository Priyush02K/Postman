The API First World
Postman has a vision for an API First World - one where 100 million developers are connected through APIs, and APIs take center stage as primary building blocks. In the API-first world:
APIs are considered a #1 priority
APIs are easily consumable
APIs are easily discoverable


Open Postman for web
You can use Postman either as a desktop app or in the web browser. This course will show you how to use Postman in the browser. 

Navigate to https://www.postman.com/

Sign in if you have an account, or sign up for free! Use your school email if you have one.

3. Install Postman Agent. This micro app will help you overcome the browser's limitations when making API calls. You can read more about it in this blog post.
